Dashboard for Human Samples of Bacteria

# Description of Project
Bio companies may require bacterial samples in order to test their ability to grow or modify new molecules in the food industry. Plant based meat substitutes is a huge emerging market in biochemistry and requires a wide range of testing on new bacteria - possibly found on the human body. This "dashboard" was built in support of bacteria collected from the navals of human volunteers. The bacteria is catalogued and then served up via the dashboard, showing those bacteria most prevalent for each human volunteer. As testing is completed by the biocompanies, volunteers can use the dashboard to see if they might be carrying/cultivating those bacteria thought to be useful -- or saleable -- to the biocompanies. 

# Resources
* HTML
* Javascript
* CD, d3 and bootsrap for formatting graphs
* GitHub public pages for serving up and presenting the results on the web
* Sample JSON file of data

# Future Recommended Changes
* Additional data -- from the biotech companies -- could be added showing what bacteria they may have already tested and found either useful or not.
